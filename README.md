# bus-schedule-python
simple cli program to show bus schedule (time and route) with ability to add new routes and save them in a database file

This simple application has three files, but don't work together.

The first file is a simple representation of time and route design for a bus schedule.

The second file adds a data entry functionality.

The third file adds to that the ability to save everything in a database file using sqlite3 (module already in Python)
